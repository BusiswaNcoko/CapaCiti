              “I am truly thankful for the wonderful donation of computers
              provided by Goodwill Tech and the National Cristina Foundation. As
              an after school educator, it was challenging with a limited
              library and outdated tools to help our youth be successful readers
              and writers. With 70% of our 3rd to 8th graders behind one to two
              grade levels in reading, we were in need of an innovative solution
              that was personalized and interactive. The donation couldn’t have
              been timelier! Thanks to the donation, each computer runs our
              reading and writing programs as part of the interventions we
              provide. Every child now has an opportunity for success and it
              shows, as 81% are now at reading level. Thank you!”

            "Thank you so very much for your generous donation of desktop
            computers. We are so excited to have received these for the parents
            of our preschool students to use during pick-up and drop-off times.
            As you are aware, access to computers is a challenge facing many
            people in our community. These units are an invaluable resource for
            our families. Again, thank you. It was so nice to meet you both on
            Monday. We shared lots of laughs as you can see in the attached
            pictures. I particularly enjoyed Ryan’s “Drinks for good” idea and
            think we should schedule a meeting at one of the local New Brunswick
            eateries sometime in the near future to further develop this idea :)
            In all seriousness, we would love to talk about participating in the
            some of the fundraisers you mentioned. I would be happy to chat via
            email or the mobile number listed below at your convenience. We look
            forward to continuing our partnership with the Goodwill Tech and
            hope to hear from you soon. "

            " The first student who received a laptop was in tears. For the
            first time, she will be able to do her homework without traveling
            out of her way to use a friend’s computer. What a wonderful gift as
            she starts her final semester at our school! Thank you for trusting
            us to connect your generosity to students in need. We are looking
            forward to continued partnership with Goodwill Tech. Regards"

            of our extra office equipment in less than a week. I cant believe we
            filled 2 full semis and know you should be able to help many people
            with all of that equipment. Will definitely suggest you to others."
